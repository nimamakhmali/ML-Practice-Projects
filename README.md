# Machine Learning Practice Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of small machine learning projects and experiments I've built while learning and practicing ML techniques. Each project is organized in its own folder with notebooks, code, and documentation.

## 🧠 Topics Covered:
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model Evaluation & Metrics
- Feature Engineering
- Real-world datasets (from Kaggle, UCI, etc.)
